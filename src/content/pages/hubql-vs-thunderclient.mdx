      Thunder Client is a lightweight API testing tool for Visual Studio Code,
      featuring collections, environment variables, scriptless testing, and
      local data storage. It supports CI/CD integration and Git synchronization
      for collaboration but lacks some advanced features found in other tools.

          Our API client runs client-side only either as a local server plugin
          for example as a NestJS plugin or distributed directly via CDN as JS
          library.
