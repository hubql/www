      ## The Power of PostgreSQL, The Speed of No-Code


      Supabase is the open-source Firebase alternative that gives you the best
      of both worlds: the robust reliability of an enterprise-grade SQL database
      (PostgreSQL) and the rapid development features of a modern
      backend-as-a-service.


      At Hubql, we don't just 'set up' your Supabase environment—we architect
      scalable, high-performance systems. We specialize in optimizing the
      platform to its fullest potential, ensuring it flawlessly handles complex
      queries, rigorous security policies, and real-time data synchronization.

          Security isn't an afterthought. We implement robust authentication
          systems (Social Logins, Magic Links, SSO) and configure strict Row

          While Supabase auto-generates APIs, complex logic requires more. We
          build custom database functions and API endpoints to handle
          sophisticated business logic and third-party integrations.
