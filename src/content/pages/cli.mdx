  #   paragraph: ''
  #   richtext: >
  #     1. **Faster Development:** Local development eliminates context switching, facilitating a quicker development process.

  #     2. **Easier Collaboration:** Developing locally streamlines collaboration
  #     with others working on the same project.

  #     3. **Cost-Effective:** Hubql offers a generous free plan.

  #     4. **Configuration in Code:** Modifying configuration directly via the
  #     Hubql platform may not be captured in code. Adopting local development
  #     practices ensures that all your preferences are stored in code.
