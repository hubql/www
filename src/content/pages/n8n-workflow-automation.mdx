      ## Connect Your Apps and Say Goodbye to Manual Work


      n8n is an open-source workflow automation platform that allows you to
      connect any app with an API to any other. Unlike traditional automation
      tools that limit you to rigid, step-by-step processes, n8n offers a visual
      interface that is intuitive for business teams, while also providing the
      flexibility of writing custom code to handle complex use cases.


      At Hubql, we leverage this unique architecture to build automations that
      are not only fast to deploy but robust enough to handle complex business
      logic, data transformation, and enterprise-grade requirements.

      ## Why Automate with n8n?


      We help you transition from manual, error-prone tasks to streamlined,
      automated systems.


      * **Save Time & Boost Productivity:** Automate repetitive reporting,
      approvals, and data entry so your team can focus on high-value strategy.

      * **Reduce Human Error:** Consistent, automated processes minimize
      mistakes in data handling and customer communication.

      * **AI-Enhanced Workflows:** We integrate LLMs and AI directly into your
      pipelines for smart decision-making, content generation, and other tasks.

      * **Always On, 24/7:** Your business processes shouldn't stop when you do.
      Our workflows run continuously, ensuring your data is synced around the
      clock.

      * **Scalable Growth:** Start with a pilot project and expand with
      confidence. n8n scales with your data volume without the skyrocketing
      per-task costs of other platforms.

      * **Data Security & Control:** Keep full control of your data. Whether
      self-hosted or cloud-deployed, we ensure your automation infrastructure
      complies with your security standards.

      * **Cost-Effective Solution:** As an open-source platform, n8n eliminates
      the burden of high licensing fees. Your only expenses are for
      implementation and ongoing support.

      ## End-to-End Automation & Integration Services


      We provide everything you need to design, build, and maintain enterprise
      automations.


      ### Workflow Automation


      From simple notifications to complex multi-step processes, we design
      visual workflows that streamline your daily operations.


      ### System Integration & API Orchestration


      Connect disparate tools (CRMs, ERPs, Payment Gateways) to ensure seamless
      data flow across your entire organization.


      ### AI & Intelligent Agents


      Embed AI capabilities into your processes. We build workflows that use
      OpenAI, Anthropic, or local LLMs to analyze data, draft responses, and
      make decisions.


      ### Custom Code & Functions


      When visual nodes aren't enough, our developers write custom
      Node.js/JavaScript functions to handle complex logic, ensuring no
      requirement is impossible.


      ### Self-Hosted & Cloud Deployment


      We deploy n8n on your preferred infrastructure (AWS, Digital Ocean,
      Private Cloud) for maximum security and control, or manage it for you in
      the cloud.


      ### Migration Services


      Moving away from Zapier or Make? We handle the migration of your existing
      scenarios to n8n, often resulting in significant cost savings and
      increased performance.


      ## What We Build with n8n


      n8n adapts to every department in your organization. Here are common
      scenarios we automate:


      * **Marketing & Lead Ops:** Automate lead capture, enrich lead data with
      external APIs, segment audiences, and trigger personalized email sequences
      24/7.

      * **Internal Operations:** Generate daily sales reports, manage document
      approvals, or send instant alerts to Slack/Teams/Email when critical KPIs
      are missed.

      * **E-commerce Automation:** Sync inventory across platforms, process
      orders automatically, and handle customer support ticket routing based on
      purchase history.

      * **Onboarding Automation: **Streamline new user or employee onboarding by
      automatically creating accounts, assigning tasks, and sending welcome
      materials across HR and Project Management systems.

      * **Logistics & Data Sync:** Extract data from email attachments
      (invoices, shipping docs) and push it directly into your database or ERP
      as structured JSON/XML.

      ## A Full-Stack Approach to Automation


      We don't just drag and drop. We engineer solutions by combining n8n with
      modern technologies to build robust applications.


      * **Databases:** Supabase, Airtable, PostgreSQL

      * **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS, Google Cloud

      * **Languages:** Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python

      * **APIs:** REST, GraphQL, Webhooks


      ## From Discovery to Deployment


      We follow a structured approach to ensure your automations deliver
      measurable value.


      1. **Discovery & Process Mapping:** We start by understanding your manual
      processes, identifying bottlenecks, and spotting high-impact automation
      opportunities.

      2. **Pilot Automation:** Before a full rollout, we build a pilot workflow
      to demonstrate value quickly and validate the solution.

      3. **Design & Development: **We then proceed to design an efficient
      workflow with proper error handling and logic, writing custom code where
      necessary to bridge gaps.

      4. **Deployment & Testing:** We deploy to your infrastructure (or ours)
      and rigorously test with real-world data scenarios.

      5. **Monitoring & Handoff: **We set up monitoring tools to track uptime
      and performance, then train your team or continue managing the system for
      you.


      ## Ensuring Your Workflows Run Smoothly


      Automation isn't "set it and forget it." APIs change, credentials expire,
      and businesses evolve. We offer comprehensive support packages to give you
      peace of mind.


      **Our Support Includes:**


      * **Continuous Monitoring:** We track workflow execution to detect
      failures before they impact your business.

      * **Error Resolution:** Rapid troubleshooting and fixing of failed
      executions.

      * **Updates & Upgrades:** Keeping your n8n instance and nodes up to date
      with the latest features.

      * **Performance Optimization:** Fine-tuning workflows as your data volume
      grows to ensure speed and reliability.


      ## Your Technical Partner for Scalable Automation

      across industries, from startups to enterprises.


      ## &#x20;FAQ


      How Much Does n8n Automation Cost?


      The cost of automation depends on the complexity of the workflows, the
      number of integrations required, and your hosting preferences.


      We generally recommend starting with a Pilot Project to prove ROI.
