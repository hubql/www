      Here are a few reasons why developers and their teams decide to switch to
      Hubql (and why you might, too).

      Scalar is a tool for generating and managing API documentation from
      OpenAPI/Swagger files, offering a customizable interface, environment
      variables, and an integrated API client. It supports real-time
      collaboration and local storage but lacks support for gRPC and Protobuf
      APIs. Learn why developers are switching from Scalar to Hubql.

          storing your request offline." className="text-2xl font-bold" />


          Our API client runs client-side only either as a local server plugin
          for example as a NestJS plugin or distributed directly via CDN as JS
          library.

          It removes the complexity associated with advanced features present in
          Scalar, offering a user-friendly environment that caters to
          individuals with varying levels of technical expertise.
