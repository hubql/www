      # Understanding HTTP Status Code 404: What It Means and How to Handle It


      When browsing the web or building an application, you've likely come
      across the infamous "404 Not Found" error. But what exactly does HTTP
      Status Code 404 mean, and why is it so common? In this blog post, we’ll
      explore the causes of a 404 error, how to handle it, and other relevant
      HTTP status codes.


      ## What is HTTP Status Code 404?


      HTTP Status Code 404 is returned when a requested resource (like a webpage
      or API endpoint) is not found on the server. It occurs when the server
      can’t locate the resource based on the URL provided, often because the URL
      is incorrect or the resource no longer exists.


      ### Why Do 404 Errors Happen?


      Several situations can cause a 404 error:


      * **Non-existent Resource:** The requested resource doesn't exist on the
      server.

      * **Temporary Unavailability:** The resource is unavailable due to a
      temporary issue.

      * **Permanent Unavailability:** The resource may have been deleted or
      moved permanently.

      * **Technical Issue:** Server or routing problems can lead to a 404
      response.


      When a 404 is encountered, the client (usually a web browser or API
      client) must handle the situation gracefully, whether that involves
      displaying an error message or suggesting a different course of action.


      ## How to Handle HTTP 404 Errors


      Handling a 404 error effectively is important for both user experience and
      search engine optimization (SEO). Here are some ways to address it:


      * **Check the URL:** Ensure the URL entered is correct, as typos are a
      common cause of 404 errors.

      * **Verify Resource Availability:** Ensure that the resource exists on the
      server and is accessible.

      * **Monitor for Temporary Issues:** Sometimes, a 404 occurs due to a
      temporary issue (e.g., server maintenance). Check if the resource is
      expected to be available later.

      * **Set Up Redirects:** If the resource has moved, you can set up a 301
      redirect to point users to the new URL, preventing unnecessary 404 errors.


      In many cases, websites and applications display custom 404 pages to guide
      users back to functional parts of the site, improving user experience.


      ## Other Common HTTP Status Codes


      The 404 error is just one of many HTTP status codes used to indicate the
      state of a server’s response. Below are other common status codes you
      might encounter:


      ### Successful Responses


      * **200 OK:** The request was successful, and the server returned the
      requested resource.

      * **201 Created:** A new resource was successfully created (often after a
      POST request).

      * **204 No Content:** The request was successful, but there is no content
      to return.


      ### Redirects


      * **301 Moved Permanently:** The requested resource has been permanently
      moved to a new URL.

      * **302 Found:** The resource has temporarily moved to a different URL.


      ### Client-Side Errors


      * **400 Bad Request:** The server couldn't understand the request due to
      invalid syntax.

      * **401 Unauthorized:** Authentication is required, but either missing or
      invalid.

      * **403 Forbidden:** The server understands the request but refuses to
      authorize it.

      * **405 Method Not Allowed:** The request method (e.g., GET, POST) is not
      supported by the resource.

      * **409 Conflict:** The request conflicts with the current state of the
      resource.

      * **410 Gone:** The resource has been permanently removed from the server.


      ### Server-Side Errors


      * **500 Internal Server Error:** The server encountered an error while
      processing the request.

      * **502 Bad Gateway:** The server received an invalid response from an
      upstream server.

      * **503 Service Unavailable:** The server is temporarily unable to handle
      the request (usually due to overload or maintenance).

      * **504 Gateway Timeout:** The server didn't receive a timely response
      from another server it relies on.


      ### Rate Limiting and Miscellaneous Errors


      * **429 Too Many Requests:** The client has sent too many requests in a
      given amount of time (rate-limiting).

      * **511 Network Authentication Required:** The client needs to
      authenticate before the network allows access to the server.


      ## Custom 404 Pages for Websites


      In addition to handling 404 errors programmatically, websites can display
      custom "404 Not Found" pages. These pages provide a user-friendly
      experience and often include helpful links, navigation options, or a
      search bar to guide the user back to relevant content.


      ## Conclusion


      HTTP Status Code 404 is an important part of the web's communication
      system, alerting users when a requested resource is missing. While it’s
      commonly encountered, there are many ways to prevent and manage 404 errors
      to ensure a smooth user experience. By understanding the broader context
      of HTTP status codes, developers can handle responses effectively and
      build more reliable systems.
