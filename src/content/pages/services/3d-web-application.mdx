      ## Immersive Digital Experiences


      The modern web is capable of console-quality graphics and deep
      interactivity, yet most business sites remain static.


      At Hubql, we push the browser to its limits. Whether it's visualizing
      complex database schemas in an infinite 2D canvas or rendering a
      photorealistic 3D product configurator, we bridge the gap between creative
      ambition and software engineering. We don't just make "cool visuals"—we
      build data-driven applications that perform at 60 FPS on any device.

      ## What We Build


      ### 3D Product Configurators


      Allow your customers to customize, rotate, and inspect your products in
      real-time. From furniture to industrial machinery, we build WebGL
      configurators that integrate directly with your inventory and checkout
      systems.


      **Best For:** E-commerce, Real Estate, Automotive.


      ### Complex Data Visualization (Canvas/WebGL)


      When standard charts aren't enough, we build interactive node graphs, ERD
      visualizers, and flowcharts that can handle thousands of data points
      without lagging. We turn spreadsheets into navigable maps.


      **Best For:** SaaS Analytics, Database Tools, FinTech.


      ### Scrollytelling & Immersive Brand Sites


      We create narrative-driven websites where scrolling controls the
      animation. These scroll-linked experiences guide users through a story,
      perfect for explaining complex hardware or high-concept services.


      **Best For:** Product Launches, Brand Storytelling.


      ### Interactive Educational Tools


      Explorable explanations. We build simulations that allow users to tweak
      variables and see real-time results, making learning (or sales training)
      active rather than passive.


      ## Technologies We Use: The Graphics Stack


      Building 3D for the web requires a specialized skill set that goes far
      beyond standard HTML/CSS.


      * **Three.js & React Three Fiber (R3F):** The industry standard for
      rendering 3D graphics in the browser.

      * **WebGL & GLSL: **We write custom shaders to create effects (water,
      fire, metal) that standard libraries can't achieve.

      * **React Flow & D3.js:** For mathematical calculations and rendering
      complex 2D node graphs.

      * **Spline:** For rapid 3D asset integration and lighter interactive
      elements.

      * **GSAP (GreenSock):** For high-performance, timeline-based animations.


      ## Why Hubql for Visual Apps?


      Many creative agencies can make a "pretty 3D scene," but they struggle to
      connect it to a database or a shopping cart.


      * Full-Stack Integration: We connect your 3D configurator directly to
      Supabase, Stripe, or your ERP. When a user changes a color in 3D, the SKU
      updates in the backend instantly.

      * Performance First: We understand "draw calls," "poly counts," and
      "texture compression." We ensure your 3D experience loads fast and doesn't
      drain your user's battery and patience.

      * Accessibility: We ensure that even immersive sites remain navigable for
      screen readers and keyboard users, balancing interactiveness with
      function.


      ## From Polygon to Pixel: Our Building Process


      1. Technical Feasibility: We assess your 3D assets and data requirements.
      Can this run in a browser? We define the constraints early.

      2. Asset Optimization: We take your CAD files or high-res models and
      retopologize (simplify) them for the web, baking textures for maximum
      realism with minimum file size.

      3. Scene Composition: We set up lighting, cameras, and physics in the
      virtual environment.

      4. Interaction Development: We code the logic—what happens when you click,
      drag, or hover?

      5. Integration & QA: We connect the visual frontend to your backend data
      and stress-test performance across mobile, tablet, and desktop.


      ## FAQ


      * Will 3D slow down my website? Not if built correctly. We use techniques
      like "lazy loading," texture compression (Draco/KTX2), and level-of-detail
      management to ensure the site loads quickly, even on mobile networks.

      * Do I need 3D models ready? It helps, but it's not required. We can work
      with 3D modelers to create assets from scratch or optimize your existing
      engineering CAD files for the web.

      * Does this work on mobile phones? Yes. Modern mobile browsers support
      WebGL natively. We design mobile-first controls (touch, pinch-to-zoom) to
      ensure the experience is intuitive on small screens.

      * What is the difference between WebGL and a video? A video is passive;
      the user just watches. WebGL is real-time rendering, meaning the user can
      control the camera, change colors, and interact with the scene. It is an
      active experience.
