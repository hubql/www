      ## Real-Time Collaboration at Scale


      We build web applications that enable teams to work together seamlessly,
      whether they're in the same room or across continents. Our collaborative
      applications support real-time updates, shared workspaces, and
      synchronized data across all connected users.

      ## What We Build


      Multiplayer Workspaces Create shared digital environments where teams can
      collaborate in real-time. From design tools to project management
      platforms, we build applications that feel natural and responsive.


      Rich Data Dashboards Transform complex data into intuitive, interactive
      dashboards. Our applications make it easy for teams to visualize, analyze,
      and collaborate around data-driven insights.


      Custom Workflows Every team works differently. We build custom workflows
      that match your processes, automating repetitive tasks and enabling your
      team to focus on what matters most.


      ## Technologies We Use


      * **Supabase** for real-time subscriptions and database management

      * **React** for responsive, interactive user interfaces

      * **WebSockets** for instant updates and synchronization

      * **Node.js** for scalable backend infrastructure


      ## Why Choose Us


      Our experience building collaborative applications means we understand the
      challenges of real-time systems, conflict resolution, and user experience
      at scale. We focus on creating applications that feel fast, reliable, and
      intuitive.
