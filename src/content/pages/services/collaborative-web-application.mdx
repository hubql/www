      ## Real-Time Collaboration and The "Google Docs" Effect


      Users today expect software to be instant. They expect to see when a
      colleague is viewing a document, to see edits happen live without
      refreshing the page, and to work simultaneously without overwriting each
      other's data.


      At Hubql, we specialize in real-time collaborative software. We move
      beyond standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) apps to build
      stateful, synchronized experiences. We make your B2B SaaS feel less like a
      database entry form and more like a shared digital office.

      ## Core Capabilities Of Our Collaborative Apps

      We engineer the specific features that drive team engagement.

      - title: Real-Time Presence & Awareness
        description: >
          "Who is looking at this right now?" We build presence indicators
          (avatars, live cursors, typing indicators) that show user activity in
          real-time, preventing redundant work and fostering a sense of team.

        description: >
          When User A updates a status, User B should see it instantly. We
          implement WebSocket architectures that push updates to all connected
          clients in milliseconds—no page reloads required.

      - title: Conflict Resolution & Locking
        description: >
          How do we handle simultaneous edits to the same field? To maintain
          data integrity, we employ sophisticated locking mechanisms or a
          "last-write-wins" approach. For text editors, we utilize more complex
          conflict resolution logic to allow for simultaneous, non-conflicting
          updates.

      - title: Contextual Commenting & Threads
        description: >
          We build "Figma-style" commenting systems that allow users to pin
          discussions directly to specific data points, images, or dashboard
          widgets, keeping communication contextual.

      ## Where Collaboration Drives Value? Real-World Use Cases.


      The possibilities for collaborative applications are vast today. To offer
      a glimpse of what can be built, here are some of the most frequent use
      cases.

      - title: Collaborative CRM & Pipelines

          **Scenario:** Sales teams working on the same leads.


          **The Feature:** When one rep opens a lead, others see their avatar.
          If the status is changed to "Closed," the pipeline board updates for
          the entire team are instantly reflected.

      - title: Multi-User Dashboards

          **Scenario:** Executives analyzing quarterly data.


          **The Feature:** Users can highlight specific charts, leave comments
          on data spikes, and filter views that synchronize across everyone's
          screen during a presentation.

          **Scenario:** Marketing teams drafting content.


          **The Feature:** Lock sections while editing, see who is typing, and
          track version history in real-time.

          Worker A, it instantly disappears from Worker B's list.

      ## Why Choose Us


      Developing a real-time multiplayer application presents complex
      engineering challenges. These include managing race conditions, preventing
      state desynchronization, and handling massive server loads. Fortunately,
      we possess the expertise to overcome all these involved challenges.

          We know how to manage the "truth" between the client and the server so
          users never see stale data.

          Real-time connections are expensive. We architect systems that scale
          to thousands of concurrent connections without crashing your database.

      - title: Optimistic UI
        description: >
          We build interfaces that react immediately to user input, syncing with
          the server in the background, so the app feels instantaneous.

          their changes and sync them back up when they reconnect.

      - title: Is "Real-Time" expensive to run?
        description: >-
          It can be if not optimized. We use Supabase, which offers a very
          generous Realtime quota, and we optimize message payloads to keep
          bandwidth costs low.
        icon: ''
      - title: Can you add collaboration to my existing app?
        description: >-
          Yes. We can inject real-time features (like a notification feed or a
          live chat) into an existing React application without rewriting the
          entire backend.
        icon: ''
      - title: How do you handle "offline" users?
        description: >-
          We implement "Optimistic UI" and local storage queues. The app assumes
          the action succeeded and updates the screen immediately, then syncs
          with the server once the connection is restored.
      - title: Is this secure?
        description: >-
          Absolutely. We use Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure that users can
          only "subscribe" to real-time updates for data they are actually
          allowed to see.
