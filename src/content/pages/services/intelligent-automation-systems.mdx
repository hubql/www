      ## From "Connecting Apps" to "Cognitive Processing"


      Traditional automation (RPA) is great for repetitive tasks—moving data
      from A to B. But modern business requires more. It requires **Intelligent
      Automation**.


      Hubql bridges the gap between traditional workflows and Artificial
      Intelligence. We build systems that can read unstructured emails, make
      decisions based on sentiment, generate personalized content, and adapt to
      changing data—turning your static operations into a dynamic, intelligent
      ecosystem.

      ## What Makes Our Automations "Intelligent"?

      We build decision engines, not just connect APIs.

        description: >
          Instead of rigid "if/then" rules, our workflows utilize LLMs (such as
          GPT or Claude) to analyze context. The system "reads" an incoming
          lead, support ticket, or document and decides the best course of
          action based on nuance, not just keywords.

        description: >
          We deploy autonomous agents capable of chaining tasks together. Give
          the agent a goal—"Research this company and draft a personalized
          outreach"—and it executes the research, scraping, and writing steps
          independently.

      - title: 3. Human-in-the-Loop Orchestration
        description: >
          Automation shouldn't be a black box. We build interfaces where the AI
          handles 90% of the work, but pauses for human approval on high-stakes
          decisions, ensuring you maintain control where it matters.

      - title: 4. Unstructured Data Processing
        description: >
          Your business runs on documents, emails, and PDFs. Our systems extract
          structured data from unstructured sources (invoices, contracts, email
          threads) and sync it to your ERP or CRM with a high level of accuracy.

          **The Old Way:** Auto-reply with a generic link.


          **The Hubql Way:** The system analyzes the ticket sentiment and
          category, drafts a technical response based on your knowledge base,
          and tags the correct engineer—reducing response time by 80%.

      - title: Is AI reliable enough for critical business processes?
        description: >-
          Yes, when architected correctly. We use "Human-in-the-Loop" systems
          for critical tasks, meaning the AI drafts the work and a human
          approves it. As confidence grows, we slowly increase autonomy.
        icon: ''
      - title: Do I need to know how to code?
        description: >-
          No. We build the systems for you. We can provide you with a simple
          dashboard to trigger workflows or view results, hiding the complexity
          under the hood.
        icon: ''
      - title: Is my data secure when using AI?
        description: >-
          We take security seriously. We can configure systems to use enterprise
          endpoints with zero data retention policies, ensuring your proprietary
          data is not used to train public models.
