      ## Our Design Philosophy


      At Hubql, we believe design is not just art, but a problem-solving tool.
      Whether you are building a complex SaaS dashboard or a high-converting
      landing page, the interface is the only part of your product that your
      customers actually interact with.


      We create pixel-perfect UIs that prioritize usability, accessibility, and
      speed of implementation. Because we are also developers, we know exactly
      how to design UIs that translate seamlessly into clean front-end code.


      ## Our UI/UX Solutions


      We are your comprehensive design agency, covering everything from visual
      identity and landing pages to complete app development.


      ### SaaS Product Design (UI/UX)


      Building a SaaS? We design intuitive dashboards, complex data tables, and
      user flows that make difficult tasks feel simple. We focus on clarity,
      ensuring your users can navigate your software without a manual.


      ### High-Conversion Landing Pages


      Your website is your best salesperson. We design landing pages focused on
      one goal: conversion. We combine persuasive copywriting structures with
      visual hierarchy to guide visitors toward the "Sign Up" button.


      ### Design Systems & Component Libraries


      Stop reinventing the wheel for every new feature. We build scalable Design
      Systems in Figma—standardizing buttons, inputs, typography, and colors—so
      your product maintains consistency as it grows.


      ### Interactive Prototyping


      Don't write a single line of code until you've tested the flow. We build
      clickable, high-fidelity prototypes in Figma that simulate the real
      application, allowing you to validate ideas with stakeholders early.


      ## Why Developers Love Our Designs


      The biggest friction point in software development is the "handover" from
      Designers to Developers. We eliminate that friction.


      * Developer-Ready Files: We use Figma's Auto-Layout, proper naming
      conventions, and organized layers. When a developer opens our files, they
      see code-ready structures, not a mess of vectors.

      * Component-Based Thinking: We design in components (Atoms, Molecules,
      Organisms) that map directly to React/Vue components, speeding up the
      development process by 50%.

      * Responsive by Default: We don't just design for desktop. We provide
      mobile, tablet, and desktop views for every screen, ensuring your product
      works on any device.

      * Accessibility First: We check contrast ratios and font readability to
      ensure your product is usable by everyone and compliant with modern web
      standards.


      ## Our Process: From Concept to Polish


      * Discovery & User Research: We start by understanding your ICP (Ideal
      Customer Profile). Who are they? What problems are they solving? What is
      their technical proficiency?

      * Wireframing & UX Flow: We map out the user journey using low-fidelity
      wireframes. We focus on structure and logic before worrying about colors.

      * Visual Design (UI): We apply your brand identity—or help you create one.
      We select typography, color palettes, and imagery that evoke trust and
      authority.

      * Prototyping & Testing: We link the screens together to test the flow.
      Does it feel right? Is the navigation intuitive?


      ## FAQ


      Common Design Questions


      * Do you do the coding too? Yes! We are a full-service agency. We can
      design the interface and then have our engineering team build it using
      Next.js, React, and Supabase. However, if you already have a dev team, we
      can provide just the design files.

      * I have a rough idea, but no brand. Can you help? Absolutely. We can help
      establish your visual identity, including logo design, color theory, and
      typography selection, before moving into web design.

      * How do you handle revisions? We work in iterative cycles. We present
      work at the wireframe stage, the concept stage, and the final polish
      stage. You have ample opportunity to give feedback and steer the direction
      before we finalize the assets.

      * Do you design for Mobile Apps? Yes. We design interfaces for both
      responsive web applications and native mobile apps (iOS/Android),
      following Human Interface Guidelines and Material Design principles.
