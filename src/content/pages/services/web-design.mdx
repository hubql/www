      ## Our Design Philosophy


      At Hubql, we believe design is not just art, but a problem-solving tool.
      Whether you are building a complex SaaS dashboard or a high-converting
      landing page, the interface is the only part of your product that your
      customers actually interact with.


      We create pixel-perfect UIs that prioritize usability, accessibility, and
      speed of implementation. Because we are also developers, we know exactly
      how to design UIs that translate seamlessly into clean front-end code.

          Building a SaaS? We design intuitive dashboards, complex data tables,
          and user flows that make difficult tasks feel simple. We focus on
          clarity, ensuring your users can navigate your software without a
          manual.

          Your website is your best salesperson. We design landing pages focused
          on one goal: conversion. We combine persuasive copywriting structures
          with visual hierarchy to guide visitors toward the "Sign Up" button.

          Stop reinventing the wheel for every new feature. We build scalable
          Design Systems in Figma—standardizing buttons, inputs, typography, and
          colors—so your product maintains consistency as it grows.

          Don't write a single line of code until you've tested the flow. We
          build clickable, high-fidelity prototypes in Figma that simulate the
          real application, allowing you to validate ideas with stakeholders
          early.

      ## Why Developers Love Our Designs


      The biggest friction point in software development is the "handover" from
      Designers to Developers. We eliminate that friction.


      * **Developer-Ready Files:** We use Figma's Auto-Layout, proper naming
      conventions, and organized layers. When a developer opens our files, they
      see code-ready structures, not a mess of vectors.

      * **Component-Based Thinking:** We design in components (Atoms, Molecules,
      Organisms) that map directly to React/Vue components, speeding up the
      development process by 50%.

      * **Responsive by Default:** We don't just design for desktop. We provide
      mobile, tablet, and desktop views for every screen, ensuring your product
      works on any device.

      * **Accessibility First:** We check contrast ratios and font readability
      to ensure your product is usable by everyone and compliant with modern web
      standards.

      ## Our Process: From Concept to Polish


      * **Discovery & User Research:** We start by understanding your ICP (Ideal
      Customer Profile). Who are they? What problems are they solving? What is
      their technical proficiency?

      * **Wireframing & UX Flow:** We map out the user journey using
      low-fidelity wireframes. We focus on structure and logic before worrying
      about colors.

      * **Visual Design (UI):** We apply your brand identity—or help you create
      one. We select typography, color palettes, and imagery that evoke trust
      and authority.

      * **Prototyping & Testing:** We link the screens together to test the
      flow. Does it feel right? Is the navigation intuitive?

      Common Design Questions

    servicesCards:
      - title: Do you do the coding too?
        description: >-
          Yes! We are a full-service agency. We can design the interface and
          then have our engineering team build it using Next.js, React, and
          Supabase. However, if you already have a dev team, we can provide just
          the design files.

      - title: 'I have a rough idea, but no brand. Can you help?'
        description: >-
          Absolutely. We can help establish your visual identity, including logo
          design, color theory, and typography selection, before moving into web
          design.
        icon: ''
      - title: How do you handle revisions?
        description: >-
          We work in iterative cycles. We present work at the wireframe stage,
          the concept stage, and the final polish stage. You have ample
          opportunity to give feedback and steer the direction before we
          finalize the assets.
      - title: Do you design for Mobile Apps?
        description: >-
          Yes. We design interfaces for both responsive web applications and
          native mobile apps (iOS/Android), following Human Interface Guidelines
          and Material Design principles.
