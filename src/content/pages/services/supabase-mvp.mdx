      ## You Have the Vision. We Have the Engine


      As a non-technical founder, your biggest risk isn't the competition—**it's
      execution speed**. Traditional software development is slow and expensive.
      You risk burning through your runway before you even get real user
      feedback.


      Hubql solves this. We partner with you to translate your business idea
      into a functioning product. We use Supabase to bypass the repetitive setup
      of "standard" features (like login, security, and APIs) so we can spend
      100% of our time building the unique features that make your product
      valuable.


      ## Enterprise Power, Startup Speed


      We choose Supabase because it allows us to build your Minimum Viable
      Product (MVP) on a foundation that doesn't need to be rebuilt when you
      scale.


      * **Launch 2x Faster:** Supabase handles the heavy lifting of backend
      infrastructure (Auth, APIs, Real-time), allowing us to ship your product
      in weeks, not months.

      * **Built for Scale:** Unlike "no-code" tools that hit a ceiling, your MVP
      is built on PostgreSQL. It can scale from 10 users to 10 million without
      migration pains.

      * **Investor Ready:** You get a professional, secure, and compliant tech
      stack that passes technical due diligence from VCs and Angel Investors.

      * **Lower Maintenance Costs:** With less custom code to manage, your
      long-term maintenance bills are significantly lower.


      ## A Complete Tech Stack, Ready for Business


      We don't deliver "prototypes." We deliver production-grade software that
      is ready for your first paying customers.


      ### 1. Secure Authentication & User Management


      Professional login systems (Email/Password, Google, LinkedIn, SSO for
      Enterprise) with role-based access control (e.g., Admin vs. User vs.
      Manager).


      ### 2. Scalable Database Architecture


      A fully modeled PostgreSQL database designed for your specific data needs,
      ensuring fast queries and data integrity.


      ### 3. Real-Time Features


      Live dashboards, notifications, and collaboration tools that update
      instantly—crucial for modern B2B SaaS engagement.


      ### 4. Custom API Development


      We build the necessary endpoints to connect your new product with tools
      your customers already use (Slack, Stripe, CRM integrations).


      ### 5. Admin Dashboard


      A control panel for you to manage users, view analytics, and control your
      platform without needing to call a developer.


      ### 6. Migration & Backup Solutions


      Moving from Firebase or a legacy SQL database? We handle the complex
      migration process with zero data loss, ensuring a smooth transition to
      your new Supabase infrastructure.


      ## Our MVP Process


      We strip away the complexity of agile jargon and give you a clear roadmap.


      1. Discovery & Scope (Week 1): We sit down with you to ruthlessly
      prioritize features. We define exactly what is needed for V1 to solve your
      customer's core problem.

      2. Architecture & Design (Week 2): We design the database schema and the
      user flow, ensuring the foundation is solid before writing code.

      3. The Build Sprint (Weeks 3-6): Our team builds your backend on Supabase
      and connects it to a responsive frontend. You get weekly updates and
      demos.

      4. Launch & Handoff (Week 7-8): We deploy your app to production, set up
      monitoring, and hand over the "keys"—full IP ownership and documentation
      included.


      ## Why Founders Choose Hubql


      We've built dozens of MVPs with Supabase. We know how to move fast without
      sacrificing quality, and we understand what it takes to launch a product
      that's ready for real users.


      * **We Speak "Business":** We explain technical trade-offs in terms of
      budget and timeline, not confusing jargon.

      * **No Vendor Lock-in:** You own 100% of the code and the intellectual
      property. Supabase is open-source, meaning you are never trapped.

      * **B2B Specialists:** We understand the nuances of B2B
      software—multi-tenancy, data privacy, and workflow automation are in our
      DNA.

      * **Post-Launch Support:** We don't disappear after launch. We offer
      flexible support packages to help you iterate based on user feedback.


      ## FAQ


      * **I'm non-technical. How will I manage the app after you finish?** We
      build your MVP with a user-friendly Admin Dashboard so you can manage
      day-to-day operations (users, content, subscriptions) yourself. For
      technical updates, we offer affordable maintenance plans, or we can help
      you hire your first in-house developer later.

      * \*\*Who owns the Intellectual Property (IP)? \*\*You do—100%. Once the
      project is paid for, we transfer all code repositories, database access,
      and accounts to you. We are your builders, not your landlords.

      * **Can this MVP scale if I get a lot of users?** Yes. Because we build on
      Supabase (PostgreSQL), your "MVP" is actually built on enterprise-grade
      infrastructure. It can handle millions of records and high traffic volumes
      without needing a rewrite.

      * **How much does an MVP cost?** Every project is different, but by using
      Supabase, we significantly reduce costs compared to traditional custom
      development. We provide a fixed-price quote after our initial scoping
      call, allowing you to budget effectively.

      * **How long will it take?** Most B2B MVPs are ready for launch in 4 to 8
      weeks. We focus on the "Core Value" features to get you to market fast.
