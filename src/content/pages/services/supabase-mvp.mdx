      ## You Have the Vision. We Have the Engine


      As a non-technical founder, your biggest risk isn't the competition—**it's
      execution speed**. Traditional software development is slow and expensive.
      You risk burning through your runway before you even get real user
      feedback.


      Hubql solves this. We partner with you to translate your business idea
      into a functioning product. We use Supabase to bypass the repetitive setup
      of "standard" features (like login, security, and APIs) so we can spend
      100% of our time building the unique features that make your product
      valuable.

      ## Enterprise Power, Startup Speed


      We choose Supabase because it allows us to build your Minimum Viable
      Product (MVP) on a foundation that doesn't need to be rebuilt when you
      scale.

          PostgreSQL. It can scale from 10 users to 10 million without migration
          pains.

    subtitle: ''
    servicesCards:
      - title: I'm non-technical. How will I manage the app after you finish?
        description: >-
          We build your MVP with a user-friendly Admin Dashboard so you can
          manage day-to-day operations (users, content, subscriptions) yourself.
          For technical updates, we offer affordable maintenance plans, or we
          can help you hire your first in-house developer later.
        icon: ''
      - title: Who owns the Intellectual Property (IP)?
        description: >
          You do—100%. Once the project is paid for, we transfer all code
          repositories, database access, and accounts to you. We are your
          builders, not your landlords.
        icon: ''
      - title: Can this MVP scale if I get a lot of users?
        description: >-
          Yes. Because we build on Supabase (PostgreSQL), your "MVP" is actually
          built on enterprise-grade infrastructure. It can handle millions of
          records and high traffic volumes without needing a rewrite.
      - title: How much does an MVP cost?
        description: >-
          Every project is different, but by using Supabase, we significantly
          reduce costs compared to traditional custom development. We provide a
          fixed-price quote after our initial scoping call, allowing you to
          budget effectively.
      - title: How long will it take?
        description: >-
          Most B2B MVPs are ready for launch in 4 to 8 weeks. We focus on the
          "Core Value" features to get you to market fast.
