      ## Your API Is a Product In Itself


      In the modern software ecosystem, your API is a product in itself, not
      just an extra feature. If it's slow, confusing, or poorly documented,
      integrations fail, developers get frustrated, and partners walk away.


      At Hubql, we take API development seriously. We focus on Developer
      Experience (DX)—ensuring that endpoints are intuitive, error messages are
      helpful, and documentation is interactive.

      ## We Offer End-to-End API Solutions


      APIs are part of our company DNA. We offer comprehensive support for every
      stage of your API project, including design, development, and deployment,
      across all project types.


      ### REST & GraphQL API Design


      We design clean, predictable architectures. Whether you need standard
      RESTful resources or a flexible GraphQL graph that allows clients to fetch
      exactly what they need, we structure your data for performance and
      maintainability.


      ### Interactive Documentation


      Add "Try it now" buttons, code snippets in multiple languages (Python, JS,
      curl), and auto-generated changelogs to your API docs. We build live,
      interactive documentation sites (using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI or
      Mintlify) where developers can test endpoints directly in the browser.


      ### Internal Platforms & SDKs


      We build the "glue" code that wraps your API. From TypeScript SDKs that
      provide type safety for your consumers, to internal admin panels that
      allow your support team to interact with the API without writing code.


      ### Legacy Modernization


      Have a slow, monolithic SOAP service? We wrap it or rewrite it into a
      modern, lightweight JSON API, enabling you to integrate with modern tools
      without rewriting your entire legacy database.


      ## Tech Stack: We Build on Open Standards


      We utilize industry-standard protocols to ensure compatibility,
      scalability, and long-term reliability.


      * **Spec Definition:** OpenAPI (Swagger) v3.0 for standardizing endpoint
      definitions.

      * **Server:** Node.js (Express/NestJS) or Supabase Edge Functions (Deno).

      * **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase) or Redis for high-speed caching.

      * **Documentation Tools: **Mintlify, Redoc, Swagger UI, and Nextra.

      * **Security**: OAuth2, JWT, and API Key management with rate limiting.


      ## Why Choose Us


      We understand that APIs are more than just endpoints — they're the
      contract between your services and the rest of the world. We focus on
      creating APIs that are well-designed, well-documented, and built to last.


      * **Security by Design:** We implement rate limiting, input validation,
      and strict CORS policies to prevent abuse. We treat every endpoint as a
      potential attack vector and secure it accordingly.

      * **Performance Caching: **We implement intelligent caching strategies
      (Redis/CDN) so that frequent requests don't hammer your database, keeping
      latency low.

      * **Type-Safe Ecosystems:** We use TypeScript end-to-end. If your database
      schema changes, your API types update automatically, preventing "silent
      failures" in production.


      ## Our API Development Process: From Spec to Server


      * **Contract-First Design:** We write the API Specification (OpenAPI YAML
      or JSON) before we write code. This allows frontend and backend teams to
      agree on the structure immediately.

      * **Mocking & Iteration:** We spin up a mock server so your frontend team
      can start building immediately, while we build the real backend logic in
      parallel.

      * **Development & Logic: **We implement the business logic, connecting to
      databases and 3rd party services.

      * **Security Audit:** We stress-test authentication flows and check for
      OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) vulnerabilities.

      * **Documentation:** We generate the docs and write the "Getting Started"
      guides that make onboarding easy.

      * **API Usage & Training:** If necessary, we can implement a real-world
      project of yours using your new API or guide your team through the
      implementation process.


      ## FAQ


      * **REST or GraphQL? Which is better?** It depends. REST is better for
      caching and simple resource management. GraphQL is better for complex,
      relational data where you want to minimize network requests. We help you
      choose the right tool for your specific data model.

      * **How do you handle API versioning? **We never break existing
      integrations. We use strict versioning strategies (e.g., /v1/, /v2/) to
      ensure that when we upgrade your system, your old partners don't crash.

      * **Can you document an API that already exists?** Yes. We can audit your
      existing codebase, reverse-engineer the logic, and generate comprehensive
      OpenAPI documentation for it.

      * **How do you secure the API?** We use industry standards like OAuth2 or
      JWT (JSON Web Tokens). For public APIs, we implement API Key management
      with usage quotas and throttling to prevent DDOS attacks.
