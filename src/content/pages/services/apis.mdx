      ## Your API Is a Product In Itself


      In the modern software ecosystem, your API is a product in itself, not
      just an extra feature. If it's slow, confusing, or poorly documented,
      integrations fail, developers get frustrated, and partners walk away.


      At Hubql, we take API development seriously. We focus on Developer
      Experience (DX)—ensuring that endpoints are intuitive, error messages are
      helpful, and documentation is interactive.

      ## We Offer End-to-End API Solutions


      APIs are part of our company DNA. We offer comprehensive support for every
      stage of your API project, including design, development, and deployment,
      across all project types.

      - title: REST & GraphQL API Design
        description: >
          We design clean, predictable architectures. Whether you need standard
          RESTful resources or a flexible GraphQL graph that allows clients to
          fetch exactly what they need, we structure your data for performance
          and maintainability.

        description: >
          Add "Try it now" buttons, code snippets in multiple languages (Python,
          JS, curl), and auto-generated changelogs to your API docs. We build
          live, interactive documentation sites (using tools like
          Swagger/OpenAPI or Mintlify) where developers can test endpoints
          directly in the browser.

      - title: Internal Platforms & SDKs
        description: >
          We build the "glue" code that wraps your API. From TypeScript SDKs
          that provide type safety for your consumers, to internal admin panels
          that allow your support team to interact with the API without writing
          code.

        description: >
          Have a slow, monolithic SOAP service? We wrap it or rewrite it into a
          modern, lightweight JSON API, enabling you to integrate with modern
          tools without rewriting your entire legacy database.

      ## Why Choose Us


      We understand that APIs are more than just endpoints — they're the
      contract between your services and the rest of the world. We focus on
      creating APIs that are well-designed, well-documented, and built to last.

      - title: Security by Design
        description: >
          We implement rate limiting, input validation, and strict CORS policies
          to prevent abuse. We treat every endpoint as a potential attack vector
          and secure it accordingly.

      - title: Performance Caching
        description: >
          We implement intelligent caching strategies (Redis/CDN) so that
          frequent requests don't hammer your database, keeping latency low.

      - title: Type-Safe Ecosystems
        description: >
          We use TypeScript end-to-end. If your database schema changes, your
          API types update automatically, preventing "silent failures" in
          production.

      - title: Contract-First Design
        description: >
          We write the API Specification (OpenAPI YAML or JSON) before we write
          code. This allows frontend and backend teams to agree on the structure
          immediately.

      - title: REST or GraphQL? Which is better?
        description: >-
          It depends. REST is better for caching and simple resource management.
          GraphQL is better for complex, relational data where you want to
          minimize network requests. We help you choose the right tool for your
          specific data model.
        icon: ''
      - title: How do you handle API versioning?
        description: >-
          We never break existing integrations. We use strict versioning
          strategies (e.g., /v1/, /v2/) to ensure that when we upgrade your
          system, your old partners don't crash.
        icon: ''
      - title: Can you document an API that already exists?
        description: >-
          Yes. We can audit your existing codebase, reverse-engineer the logic,
          and generate comprehensive OpenAPI documentation for it.
      - title: How do you secure the API?
        description: >-
          We use industry standards like OAuth2 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens). For
          public APIs, we implement API Key management with usage quotas and
          throttling to prevent DDOS attacks.
