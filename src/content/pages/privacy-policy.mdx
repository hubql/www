      General Information and Mandatory Disclosures


      Designation of the Responsible Entity


      The responsible entity for data processing on this website is:


      Robin Gieck


      Hubql GmbH


      Schlachthofstraße 1


      96450 Coburg


      The responsible entity decides alone, or jointly with others, on the
      purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, contact
      details, or similar).


      ⸻


      **Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing**


      Some data processing operations are only possible with your explicit
      consent. You may revoke any previously granted consent at any time. A
      simple informal message via e-mail is sufficient. The legality of the data
      processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected.


      ⸻


      **Right to File a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority**


      As a data subject, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the
      competent supervisory authority in the event of a data protection
      violation. The competent authority for data protection issues is the state
      data protection officer of the federal state in which our company is
      located. The following link provides a list of data protection officers
      and their contact details:

      ⸻


      **Right to Data Portability**


      You have the right to have data, which we process automatically based on
      your consent or in fulfillment of a contract, handed over to yourself or
      to third parties. The data will be provided in a machine-readable format.
      If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this
      will occur only insofar as it is technically feasible.


      ⸻


      **Right to Access, Rectification, Blocking, Deletion**


      Within the scope of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at
      any time to receive free information about your stored personal data, its
      origin, recipients, and the purpose of the data processing. You may also
      have the right to rectification, blocking, or deletion of this data if
      applicable. For this and for any other questions regarding personal data,
      you can contact us at any time using the contact details listed in the
      legal notice (Impressum).


      ⸻


      **SSL and TLS Encryption**


      For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
      content that you send to us as the site operator, our website uses SSL or
      TLS encryption. This means that data you transmit via this website cannot
      be read by third parties. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the
      “https\://” address line in your browser and the lock symbol in the
      browser bar.


      ⸻


      **Cookies**


      Our website uses cookies—small text files stored by your web browser on
      your device. Cookies help make our services more user-friendly, efficient,
      and secure.


      Some cookies are “session cookies,” which are automatically deleted after
      your browser session ends. Other cookies may remain stored on your device
      until you delete them yourself. These cookies help us recognize you when
      you return to our website.


      Modern browsers allow you to monitor, restrict, or block the setting of
      cookies. Many browsers can also be configured to delete cookies
      automatically upon closing. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality
      of our website.


      The setting of cookies necessary for electronic communication processes or
      for providing certain functions requested by you (e.g., shopping cart) is
      based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. As the website operator, we have a legitimate
      interest in storing these cookies to ensure the technically error-free and
      seamless provision of our services. If other cookies are set (e.g., for
      analytics purposes), they are addressed separately in this privacy policy.


      ⸻


      **Third-Party Services**


      To simplify our data processing and expand our website’s functionality, we
      use services and resources from third-party providers, such as plugins,
      external content, software, or other external service providers
      (“services”). Personal data may also be transferred to these providers.


      If data processing occurs on our behalf, we have contractually obligated
      the providers under Art. 28 GDPR to process your data only according to
      our instructions. We expressly point out that we are typically responsible
      only for the collection and transmission of data through the service, but
      not for any further processing by the respective provider.
