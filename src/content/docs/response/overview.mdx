### Work with API response data and cookies in Hubql

An API response is the data returned by an API server after it receives a request from a client. You can use Hubql to inspect response data, create visualizations, and troubleshoot problems.

### View and save responses

When you send an API request, Hubql displays the response from the API server. You can view the response details in the response viewer, including the response code, response body, and headers. You can also use the Hubql Schema Visualizer to create rich graphic visualizations of the response data.
