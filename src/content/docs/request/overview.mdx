### Create and send API requests in Hubql

You can use the Hubql API client to connect to your APIs. Build and send API requests with parameters, body data, and headers.

### Build API requests in Hubql

Use Hubql to create and send API requests using HTTP or other common protocols. You can send parameters and body data with your requests, and send request headers, as required by your API.

### Upload test data to your team

Hubql enables you to share your test data with others on your Hubql workspace. You can generate data files in your workspace, and anyone on your workspace can use the uploaded files as raw body data when sending requests in Hubql.

### Organize requests with Hubql Hubs

You can save and organize your API requests in Hubs so you can use them over and over. Use Hubs to collaborate with your team, generate API tests and documentation, and automate request sending.

### Authentication

Hubql enables you to send auth details along with your API requests. Most commonly, APIs use authentication and authorization to ensure that the client requests secured data. Authentication verifies the identity of the request, while authorization validates the sender's permission access and allows the endpoint’s operation.
