## Be one of 5 Founding Partners and shape the future of API Developer Experience

Hubql is launching, and we’re offering **only 5 companies** the chance to become **Founding Partners**. This exclusive program is designed for forward-thinking teams who want early access, lifetime perks, and a chance to shape the future of API development.

Here’s your chance to be part of the next evolution in API documentation, development, and collaboration. **This opportunity will only be available to the first 5 partners.**

---

## **What is Hubql and the vision behind it?**

Hubql is a next-generation API platform that makes it easier for teams to document, and collaborate on APIs.

We start from building UI components for API documentation, and then build a platform to make it easy for teams to share and collaborate on APIs.

Unlike most API tools, Hubql is built with a few key principles in mind:

- **Team-Based Pricing, Not Seat-Based** — No more counting seats. Your whole team can work together.  
- **OpenAPI as Source of Truth** — Sync your API docs automatically from your OpenAPI schema.  
- **Local-First, Privacy-Focused** — API testing without cloud sync, no privacy concerns. Work local, self-hosted sync when needed.  

With Hubql, growing teams can build together, stay in sync, and avoid the frustration of manual syncs and fragmented tools.

## Why another tool?

We have been working with various API tools over the years and been dissatisfied with the tools we have used, either by the lack of beauty, or by the lack of open-source and privacy-focused tools.

Working with various teams we found many hacking their way around seat-based pricing with weird and inefficient workflows, 

In some cases shareholder interest is also not aligned with developer experience or the purpose of the tool.

We like to change this with Hubql by providing a platform open-source for teams.

Software development is changing, documentation, testing and collaboration is becoming more relevant when building and write code is accelerating.

## **Why do we need a Founding Partner?**

Hubql has been a self-funded company since its inception in 2023.

Over the past few months we have been building APIs for customers and worked with other teams learning how some of the API development workflows lack efficiency.

We have always keen on building developer tools for others to help them work more efficiently.

Also, we believe building developer tools should be open-source and accessible to everyone.

Building open-source is great but requires funding and commitment from companies and individual to keep it sustainable with focus.

Simply, we won't be able to take off without support founding partners.

## **Why become a Founding Partner?**

Being a Founding Partner of Hubql isn’t just about early access — it’s about being part of the story. Here’s why you may join:

### **1️⃣ Lifetime Access to the Hubql Pro Plan**  
Founding Partners get full access to the **Pro Plan for life**. No monthly fees. No seat-based pricing. Just pure access to everything you need to grow your API development workflows.

**Value:** Normally 475 EUR/month = **28,500 EUR over 5 years** — all included for a one-time fee.

### **2️⃣ Your logo featured on our website**  
Showcase your brand as one of the key supporters of the next-generation API platform. As a Founding Partner, your company’s logo will be featured on our homepage, documentation and repo READMNE as a supporter of modern API development.

### **3️⃣ Shape & access to new features**  
Founding Partners get early access to new features before public release. Be the first to test new functionality and ensure it fits your team’s needs.

### **4️⃣ Priority support and onboarding**  
Receive a **1:1 onboarding session** with our product team to ensure your experience is smooth from the start. As a Founding Partner, you’ll also have priority support access — meaning you’re always at the front of the line.

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**What happens after the 5 spots are filled?**  
Once we secure 5 Founding Partners, the program closes, and no new partners will be accepted. This ensures exclusivity and keeps our promise of early access, influence, and exclusive benefits.

**Is the payment refundable?**  
No. Since you’re securing lifetime access and early access benefits, the payment is final. This also helps us fund development and give you a better product.

**Will I really get lifetime access to the Pro Plan?**  
Yes, absolutely. As a Founding Partner, you will never have to pay monthly or yearly fees for Hubql’s Pro Plan.

**What’s included in the onboarding call?**  
We’ll walk you through our plan and vision, and answer any questions you have to make sure you’re set up for success and the right partner.

**Can I upgrade to the Enterprise Plan later?**  
Yes, but the Founding Partner deal locks in lifetime access to the Pro Plan. If you’re interested in Enterprise features, we’ll work with you on that as needed.

**Is this open-source?**
Yes, our libraries will be available under MIT Licenses and Apache 2.0 for the platform that is going to be available for self-hosting.
